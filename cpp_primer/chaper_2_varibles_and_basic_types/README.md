## 2.1 Primitive Build-in Types
C++ defines a set of primitive types that include the **arithmetic types** and a special type nemed **void**.The arithmetic types represent characters, integers, boolean values, and floating-point numbers. The void types has no assoicated values and can be used in only a few circustances, most commonly as the return type for functions that do not return a value.

### 2.1.1 arithmetic types
The arithmetic types are devided into two categories: **integral types**(which include chacter and boolean types) and floating-point types.

The size of--that is, the number of bits in--the arthmetic types varies across machines.The standard guarantees minimum sizes as listed in Table.However,compilers are allowed to use larger sizes for these typse.

| type        | mieaning                          | Miniumn Size          |
|:----------- |:--------------------------------- |:--------------------- |
| bool        | boolean                           | NA                    |
| char        | character                         | 8 bits                |
| wchar_t     | wide character                    | 16 bits               |
| char16_t    | unicode character                 | 16 bits               |
| car32_t     | unicode character                 | 32bits                |
| short       | short integer                     | 16bits                |
| int         | integer                           | 16bits                |
| long        | long integer                      | 32bits                |
| long long   | long integer                      | 64bits                |
| float       | single-precision floating-point   | 6 significant digits  |
| double      | double-precision floating-point   | 10 significant digits |
| long double | extended-precision floating-point | 10 significant digits |

The bool type represent the truth values true and false.

There are several character types,most of which exists to support international-
ization.The basic character type is char. A char is guaranteed to be big enough
to hold numetic values corresponding to the characters in the machine's basic
character set.That is, a char is the same size as a single machine byte.

#### signed  and unsigned types.

A signed type represents negative or positive numbers(including zero);an unsigned type represents only values greater than or equal to zero.

Unlike the other integer types,there are three distinct basic character types:
char,singed char,and unsigned char.In particular,char is not the same as signed char.The (plain) char types uses one of these representations.Which of the other two character representations is equivalent to char depends on the compiler.

In an unsigned type,all the bits represent the value. For example, an 8-bit unsigned char can hold the values from 0 through 255 inclusive.

### 2.1.2 Type convensions
```cpp
bool b = 42; // b is true
int i = b; // i has value 1
i = 3.14; // i has value 3
double pi = 1; // pi has value 3.0
unsigned char c = -1; // assuming 8-bit cahrs, c has value 255
signed char c2 = 256; // assuming 8-bit cahrs,the value of c2 si undefined
```
- if we assigned an out-of-range value to an object of signed type, the result is **undifined**.The program might appear to work, it might crash, or it might produce garbage values.

#### Expressions Involving Unsigned Types
```cpp
unsigned u = 10;
int i = -42;
std::cout << i + i << '\n'; // prints -84
std::cout << u + i << '\n'; // if 32-bits ints, prints 4294967264
```
```python
>>> 2 ** 32
4294967296
>>> _ + 10 - 42
4294967264
```
- Don't mix signed and unsigned types

```cpp
unsigned u1 =  42, u2 = 10;
std::cout << u1 - u2 << '\n'; // ok:result is 32
std::cout << u2 - u1 << '\n'; // ok:but the result will wrap around
```

### 2.1.3 literals
A value, such as 42, is known as a **literal** because its a value self-evident. Every literal has a type. The form and values of a literal determine its type.

#### Integer and Floating-point Literals
Integer literals that begin with 0 are interpreted as octal.

Those that begin with `0x` or `0X` are interpreted as hexadecimal.
` 20 /* deciaml */ 024 /* octal */   0x14 /* hexadecimal */ `

Although integer literals may be stored in signed types,technically speaking, the value of a decimal literal is never a negative number.If we write what apperas to a negative decimal lieteral, the minus sign is *not* part of the literal.The minus sign is an operator that negats the value of its (literal) operand.

Using scientific notation, the expoent is indiciated by either `e` or `E`:
```
3.14   3.14E0  0. 0e0
```
#### Character and charater string literals
```cpp
'a' // character literal
"hello world" // string literal
```
The type of a string literal is **array** of constant chars.

#### Escape Sequences
Some characters, such as backspace or control character,have no visible image.Such characters are **nonprintable**.We use an **escape sequence** to represent such characters.

| name         |       | name            |       |
|:------------ |:----- | --------------- | ----- |
| newline      | `\n`  | horizontial tab | `\t ` |
| vertical tab | `\v`  | alert(bell)     | `\a`  |
| backspace    | `\b ` | double quote    | `\"`  |
| blackslash   | `\\`  | question mark   | `\?`  |
| single quote | `\'`  | carriage return | `\r`  |
| formfeed     | `\f`  |                 |       |

We can also write a generalized escape sequence,which is \x followed by one or more hexadecimal digits or a \ followed by one,two,or three octal digits.
```
\7 bell \12 newline  \40 blank
\0 null \115 'M' \x4d 'M'
```

Note that if a \ is followed by more than three octal digits,only the first three sociated with the \.
```cpp
\1234
```
represents two characters: the character represented by the octal value `123` and the character `4`. In contrast, `\x` uses up all the hex digits following it.
```cpp
\x1234
```
reprents a single, 16-bit character composed from the bits corresponding to these for hexadecimal digits.

#### Specifying the type of a Literal
```cpp
L'a' // wide character literal,type is wchar_t
u8"hi!"// utf-8 string literal
42ULL // unsigned integer literal, type is unsigned long long
1E - 3F //single-percision floating-point literal,type is float
3.14159L // extended-persion floating-point literal,type is long double
```

Character and character String Literals

|:------ |:-------------------------- | -------- |
| u      | unicode 16 character       | char16_t |
| U      | unicode 32 character       | char32_t |
| L      | wide character             | wchar_t  |
| u8     | utf-8(string liters only ) | char     |

Integer Literals

| Suffix   | Minium Type |
|:-------- |:----------- |
| u or U   | unsigned    |
| l or L   | long        |
| ll or LL | long long   |

Floating- point Literals

|:------ |:----------- |
| f or F | float       |
| l or L | long double |

#### boolean and Pointer Liters
the word `true` and `False` are literals of type *bool*

The world `nullptr` is a pointer literal.

## 2.2 Variables
A *variable* provides us with named storage that our program can manipulate.

### 2.2.1 Variable Definitions

A simple variable definition consists of a **type specifier**, followed by a list of one or more variable names separated by commas,and ends with semicolon.
```cpp
int sum = 0 , value;
std::string book("0-201-78345-x")// book initalized from string literal
```

#### Initalizers
An object that is **initalized** gets the specified value at the moment it is created.

#### List Initialization

We can use any of the following ways to define an int variable named units_sold and ititalize it to 0:
```cpp
int units_sold = 0;
int units_sold = {0};
int units_sold{0};
int units_sold(0);
```
The gengeralized use of curly brace for Initialization was introduced as part of the new standard.

When used with variables of built-in type, this form of Initialization has one important property: The compiler will not let us initialize variables of  build-in type if the initializer might lead to the loss of information:
```cpp
long double ld = 3.1415926536;
int a{ld}, b = {ld}; //error narrowing conversion required
int c(ld), d = ld; // ok: but value will be truncated
```
#### Default Initialization
When we defined a variable without an initializer, the variable is **default initalized**.Such variables are given the "default" value.What that default value is depends on the type of the variable and may also depend on where the value is depends.

The value of an object of build-in type that is not explicitly initialized depends on where it is defined,Variables defined outside any function body are initalized to zero.

Most classes let us define objects without explicitly initializers. Such class supply an appropriate default value for us.For example, as we've seen,the library string class says that if we do not supply an initializer,then the resulting string is the empty string:
```cpp
std::string empty;// empty implicitly initialized to the empty string
Sales_item item; // default-initialized Sales_item object
```

Some classes require that every object be explicitly initialized. The compiler will complain if we try to create an object of such a class with no initializer.

### 2.2.2 Variable Declarations and Definitions

To allow programs to be written in logical parts,C++ supports what is commonly known as **sparate compilation**.Separate compilation lets us split our programs into several files, each of which can be compiled independently.

A **declaration** makes a name known to the program.A file that wants to use a name defined elsewhere includes a declaration for that time. A **definition** creats the assoicated entity.

To obtain a declaration is not also a definition, we add `extern` key-word and may not provide an explicit initalizer:
```cpp
extern int i; // declares but does not define i
int j; // declares and defines j
```
Any declaration that includes an exp;ict initialzer is a definition. We can provide an ititializer on a variable defined as `extern`, but doing so overrides the `extern`. An extern that has an initalizer is a definition:
```cpp
extern double pi = 3.1416; // definition (ERROR:extern double pi = 3.1416;)

```
It is an error to provide an initialzer on an `extern` inside a function

*Variables must be defined exactly once but can be declared many times*
To use a variable in more than one file requires declarations that are separate from the variable's definition.To use the same variable in multiple files,we must define that variable in one——and only one——file.Other files that use the variable must declare--but not define--that variable.

### 2.2.3 Identifiers

**Identifiers** in C++ can be composed of letters,digits,and the underscore character.

#### Conventions of variable Names
- An identifier should give some indication of its meaning.
- Variable names normally are lowercase.
- Class we difine usually begin with an uppercase letter.

### Scope of Name
A **scpoe** is a part of the program in which a name has a particular meaning. Most of C++ are delimited by curly braces.

The dame name can refer to diffierent entities(实体) in different scopes.

```cpp
int main(int argc, char const *argv[]) {
  int sum = 0, var = 1;
  // keeping executing the while as long as val is less than or equal to 10
  for (int val = 1; val <= 10; val++) {
    sum += val;
  }
  std::cout << "Sum of 1 to 10 inclusive is " << sum << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```
The name `main` defined outside any curly braces. The name `main` -- like most names difines outside a function--has **global scope**.Once declared, names at the global scope are accessible throughout the problem.The variable `sum` has **block scope**.The naem `val` is difined in the scope of the `for` statement. It can be used in that statement but not elsewhere in main.

#### Nested Scopes
scopes can contain other scopes. The contain(or nested) scope is reffered to as an **inner scope**,the containing scope is the outer scope.

Once a name has been declared in a scope,that name can be used by scopes nested inside that scope. Names declared in the outer scope can also be redefined in an inner scope:

[区分全局变量与局部变量](./nested_scope.cpp)

It is almost a;ways a bad idea to defined a local variable with the same name as a global variable that the function uses or might use.

## 2.3 Compound Types

**A compound type** is a type that is defined in terms of another type. C++ has several compound types, two of which--reference and pointers--we'll cover in this chapter.

A declaration is a *base type* followed by a list of **declarators**.Each declarator names a variable and gives the variable a type that is ralated to the base type.

### 2.3.1 References

A **reference** defines an alternative name for an object. A referenc type "refers to" another type. We define a type by writing a declartor of the form `&d` where `d` is the name being declared:
```cpp
int ival = 1024;
int &refVal = ival; // refval refers to(is another name for) ival
int &refVal2; // error: a reference must be initialized
```
Ordinarily when we initialize a variable, the value of the initalizer is copied into the object we are creating. When we define a reference, instead of copying the initializer's value,we **bind** the reference to its initializer. Once initialized, a reference remains bound to its initial object.Because there is no way to rebind a reference,references must be initialized.

#### A reference is an Alias

- A reference is not an object.Instead a reference is *just another name for an already existing object.*

After a reference has been defined, all operations on that reference are actually operations on the objects to which the reference is bound:
```cpp
refVal = 2; // assigns 2 to the object which refval refers,i.e.,to ival
int ii = refVal; // same as ii = ival
```
reference is not objects,we may not define a reference to a deference.
```cpp
int &refVal3 = refval;// ok:refVal3 is bound to the object to which refVal is bound,i.e,to ival
int i = refVal; // ok:initializes i to the same value as ival
```

#### Reference Definitions
We can define mutiple reference in a single definition.Each identifier that is a reference must be preceded by the `&` symbol.

```cpp
int &refVal = 10; // error: initializer must be an objects
double dval = 3.14;
int &refVal5 = dval; //error: initializer must be an int object
```

### 2.3.2 Pointers
A **pointer** is a compound type that "point to" another type. Like reference,pointers are used for indirect access to others objects. Unlike a reference, a pointer is an onject in its own right. Pointers can be assigned and copied; a single pointer can point to several different objects over its lifetime.

#### Taking the Adress of an Object
A pointer holds the adress of another object. We get the adress of an object by using the address-of operator(the **& operator**)

The type must match because the type of the pointer is used to infer the type of the object to which the pointer points. If a pointer adressed an object of another type, operations performed on the underlying(基本的) object would fail.

#### Pointer Value
The value(i.e., the adress) stored in a pointer can be in one of four states:
1. It can point to an object.
2. It can point to the location just immediatelly past the end of an object.
3. It can be a null pointer, incicatiing that it is not bound to any object.
4. It can be invailed; values other than the preceding three are invalid.

Although pointers int case 2 and 3 are valid ,there are limits on what we can do with such pointers. Because these pointers do not to any object, we may not use them to access the (supposed) object to which the pointer points.If we do attempt to access an object through such pointers, the behavior is undifined.

#### Using a Pointer to Access Object
When a pointer pointers to an object, we can use the dereference operator(the **`*` operator**) to access that object.

Dereferencing a pointer yields the object to which the pointer points. We assign to that object by assigning to the dereference.

#### Null Pointers
A **null pointer** does not point to any object. Code can check whether a pointer is null before attempting to use it. There are several ways to obtain a null pointer:
```cpp
int *p1 = nullptr; // equivalent to int *p1 = 0
int *p2 = 0;// directly initialize p2 from the literal constant 0
// must #include <ctdlib>
int *p3 = NULL;
```

The most direct approach is to initialize the pointer usng the literal **nullptr**, which was introduced to any other pointer type. Alternatively, we can initalize a pointer to the literal 0.

Other programs sometimes use a **preprocessor variable** named `NULL`,which the `cstdio` header defines as 0.

#### void* Pointers
The type void* is a special type that can hold the adress of any object.Like other pointer, a void* pointer holds an adress, but type of the object at that adress unknown:
```cpp
double obj = 3.14, *pd = &obj;
void *pv = &obj;// ok:obj can be an object of any type
pv = pd;// pv can hold a pointer to any type.
```
We cannot use a void* to operate on the object it adress--we don't know that object's type, and type determines what operations we can perform on the object.

### 2.3.3 Understanding Compound Type Declarations
#### Pointers to points
In general, there are no limits to how many type midifiers can be applied to a declarator. When there is more than modifier, they combine that are logical but not always obvious.

```cpp
  int ival = 1024;
  int *pi = &ival;
  int **ppi = &pi;
```
ppi -> pi -> ival
